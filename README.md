#### What I believe is good to look at the site


1 - Auto-complete: I believe we could help customers to find what they are looking for offering an auto-complete feature from the click in search field, we can use a hot words or categories we want to work on to suggest.

2 - “Did you mean?” we can help them when a typing  error occur, for example, when a customer type “sapatoo”, we should ask them if they wanted to mean “sapato”, already offering products when the word is close to what we believe it to be. Today, the costumer go to a page with no products, only some categories that are not always related to the search, and this only happens in the web version, in the mobile app neither a message is displayed.

3 - Categories page - We have a meta text at the end of page, but the customer who wants to read it, need to wait all auto paging product to do it. This is a bit frustrating when one really wants to read the text.

##### Why am I want to join the #AMAROteam?

This was the best test I had to work on, and I worked hard, I really wanted to finish it, and unfortunately I could not, it showed me that I need to evolve more to get where I want to go. I think that's the first big reason. The second reason is because I believe in the company's business, the test made me study and learn about the business model, it is disruptive and well structured, full of possible challenges to be realized. The third is the environment, which in my eyes seemed to be composed of qualified people who can help me grow both as a person and professionally.

###### Thanks
I would like to thank the opportunity, unfortunately, I was not able to finish the test, but I learn a lot, and I hope in a short time, participate again, I will seek more knowledge and keep an eye on Amaro's opportunities =)
